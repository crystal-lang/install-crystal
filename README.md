```

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - uses: crystal-lang/install-crystal@v1
    with:
      crystal: 1.2
  - run: shards install
  - run: crystal spec
```

```yaml
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        include:
          - {os: ubuntu-latest, crystal: latest}
          - {os: ubuntu-latest, crystal: nightly}
          - {os: macos-latest}
          - {os: windows-latest}
    runs-on: ${{matrix.os}}
    steps:
      - uses: crystal-lang/install-crystal@v1
        with:
          crystal: ${{matrix.crystal}}
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: shards install
      - run: crystal spec
      - run: crystal tool format && git diff --exit-code

Alternatively, you can use the container-based approach [as in the starter workflow][crystal-starter] (without this action), but the advantage here is the unified approach to installation across 3 systems. [Using a custom container has disadvantages on its own, too](https://forum.crystal-lang.org/t//2837).

## Usage

### Inputs

 *   *  **`crystal: 1.1.0`**, **`crystal: 1.2`** (not supported on Windows)

        Install a particular release of Crystal (if the full version is specified), or the latest patch version of a release series.

     *  **`crystal: latest`** (default; not supported on Windows)

        Install the latest released version of Crystal.

     *  **`crystal: nightly`** (default on Windows)

        Install Crystal from the latest continuous build on [crystal.git][] master.

 *   *  **`shards: true`** (default)

        Ensure that *some* released version of [Shards][] is available.
        This uses the build that's bundled with Crystal's releases. Other options are slower, as building Shards is a necessary step then.

     *  **`shards: false`**

        Ensure that `shards` executable is *not* available.

     *  **`shards: latest`**

        Build and install the latest released version of Shards.

     *  **`shards: 0.14.0`**, **`shards: 0.16`**

        Build and install a particular release of Shards (if the full version is specified), or the latest patch version of a release series.

     *  **`shards: nightly`**

        Build and install the latest commit of [shards.git][] master.

 *  **`arch: x86_64`**, **`arch: x86`** (defaults to current OS arch)

    The architecture of the build of Crystal to download.

 *  **`destination: some/path`**

    The directory to store Crystal in, after extracting. Will directly affect `outputs.path` (the default is in a temporary location).

 *  **`annotate: true`** (default)

    Display compilation and spec errors as GitHub code annotations.

 *  **`token: ${{ github.token }}`**

    Personal access token (auto-populated).

### Outputs

 *  **`crystal`** (`${{ steps.some_step_id.outputs.crystal }}`)

    The actual version of Crystal (as a ref in crystal-lang/[crystal.git][]) that was installed.

 *  **`shards`** (`${{ steps.some_step_id.outputs.shards }}`)

    The actual version of Shards (as a ref in crystal-lang/[shards.git][]) that was installed.

 *  **`path`** (`${{ steps.some_step_id.outputs.path }}`)

    The path where Crystal was extracted to, so you can use '[path]/bin/crystal', '[path]/src' etc.
